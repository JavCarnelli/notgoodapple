# notgoodapple

In this little project the music video of "Bad Apple" is casted into some little apples using them as pixels for the image. ![](https://github.com/JavCarnelli/notgoodapple/blob/main/assets/images/little_apple16x16.png?raw=true)

The code is pretty simple and i've leaved comments in it to make more easy the reading and comprehension.
This small project was made in about 2 hours.

If you open the project the video will play automatically. You can use the arrows to raise and lower the volume a bit.
Pressing the "esc" button the application will close.

Greetings!
Jav
